# permissions

This is the more fleshed out example form the readme.

## Installation

You'll need [haskell][] to run the server.

The easiest way is to install [stack][].

## Build

You should be able to build everything with:

```
stack build
```

Then you can run the server as:

```
stack exec permissions
```

Next you can start the elm-reactor:

```
elm-reactor
```

And visit the browser at [http://localhost:8000]().
